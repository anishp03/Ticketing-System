# Ticketing-System
This program is a class project that reads in a list of employees, including tier 2 experienced employees and tier 1 beginner employees. Then the program reads in ticket data from 2 csv files where one is tier 1 tickets that are paired with beginner employees, and tier 2 are paired with tier 2 employees. Finally, the data is combined within an output work order file that lists all of the assignments for each employee, along with the current date and time the work order was created.
